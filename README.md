4. You will see the follwing messages,
> <pre>
> Creating king
> Configuring kind
> Staring kind

><pre>Name:           kind
>State:          Running
>Snapshots:      0
>IPv4:           XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

11. Type the following command to stand up a multi node Kubernetes cluster.
> <pre>kind create cluster --config kind.yaml
12. Check your Kubernetes cluster
> <pre>kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind
13. To destroy the VM type the following command in Powershell.
> <pre>multipass stop kind
> multipass delete kind
> multipass purge
14. For more information on `multipass` command, please do read the documentation at https://canonical.com/multipass/docs
15. If you wan to customize the automation of this Hyper-V VM, `git clone` this repository, read Cloud-Init documentaiont at https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html and start hacking.

### For Windows 10
1. If you are on Windows 10, you will not have access to Hyper-V. However, you still have WSL.
2. Enable WSL with instructions from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install\
3. It is highly recommanded for you to do the following steps in Windows Terminal Powershell. Follow the instruction at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install to instal Windows Terminal.
4. Create a new Folder on you Windows 10 file system.
5. In Powershell, change directory to your new Folder.
6. Download this file https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/wsl/noble/current/ubuntu-noble-wsl-amd64-ubuntu.rootfs.tar.gz into your current Folder.
7. Download this file https://github.com/tsanghan/mcka/releases/latest/download/cloud-config.yaml
8. Copy the file `cloud-config.yaml` to `$HOME\.cloud-init\kind.user-data`
9. If you are in CMD, the destination file will be `%userprofile%\.cloud-init\kind.user-data`
10. Run the following command in Powershell,
> <pre>wsl --import kind .\kind ubuntu-noble-wsl-amd64-ubuntu.rootfs.tar.gz
11. You will see the messages show below.
> <pre>Import in progress, this may take a few minutes.
> The operation completed successfully.
12. Next type the following command.
> <pre>wsl -d kind
13. You will be droped into a `BASH shell` as `root`.
14. Wait till you are kick off the `BASH shell` and back into `Powershell`.
15. Back at Powershell, type the following command.
> <pre>wsl -d kind -u student --cd ~
16. You are starting up your new WSL distribution and will be drop into a `BASH` session as `student` and will be place into `student`'s HOME directory.
17. In WSL, change directory to `~/Projects/kind`
18. Type the following command to stand up a multi node Kubernetes cluster.
> <pre>kind create cluster --config kind.yaml
19. Check your Kubernetes cluster
> <pre>kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind
20. To exit BASH shell, type `Ctrl-d` to go back to `Powershell`
21. To destroy your WSL distribution.
> <pre>wsl --unregister kind
22. If you wan to customize the automation of this WSL distribution, `git clone` this repository, read Cloud-Init documentaiont at https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html and start hacking.
